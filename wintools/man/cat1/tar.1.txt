NAME
       tar - manual page for tar 1.13

SYNOPSIS
       tar [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  `tar'  saves many files together into a single tape
       or disk archive, and can restore individual  files  from
       the archive.

       If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it
       is mandatory for the equivalent short option also.  Sim-
       ilarly for optional arguments.

   Main operation mode:
       -t, --list
              list the contents of an archive

       -x, --extract, --get

       -c, --create
              create a new archive

       -d, --diff, --compare
              find differences between archive and file system

       -r, --append
              append files to the end of an archive

       -u, --update
              only append files newer than copy in archive

       The backup suffix is `~', unless set  with  --suffix  or
       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The  version  control may be set
       with --backup or VERSION_CONTROL, values are:

       t, numbered
              make numbered backups

       nil, existing
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple other-
              wise

       never, simple
              always make simple backups

       GNU  tar cannot read nor produce `--posix' archives.  If
       POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in the  environment,  GNU  exten-
       sions  are disallowed with `--posix'.  Support for POSIX
       is only partially implemented, don't count  on  it  yet.
       ARCHIVE  may  be  FILE, HOST:FILE or USER@HOST:FILE; and
       FILE may be a file or a device.  *This*  `tar'  defaults
       to `-f- -b20'.
